The course provides a comprehensive treatment of neural networks and deep learning, intended for students of mathematical degrees (e.g. data science, computer science, physics or statistics) interested in the fundamentals. The focus on the course is on detailed mathematical treatment of the learning algorithms and other foundational aspects of neural networks, but we will also cover typical deep learning architectures and use deep learning frameworks for implementing practical models. The course will introduce typical neural network architectures (e.g. convolutional neural networks) and their main motivations, but will not go into details of specific architectures (e.g. ResNet50 or BERT).

The technical content varies slightly according to the implementation, but covers approximately:

- Neural network concepts: Units, losses, activation functions
- Gradient-based learning: Stochastic gradients, adaptive optimization methods
- Deep learning software frameworks and automatic differentiation
- Regularization of neural networks
- Neural network architectures and designs (MLP, CNN, RNN, and their variants)
- Theory of self-supervised learning and generative AI
- Advanced learning tasks (structured outputs, autoencoders, adversarial training, transfer learning, etc.)
- Selected timely concepts in deep learning (e.g. deep generative models or transformers)
